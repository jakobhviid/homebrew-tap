# Immich Mount without the app, for a server or a session with no desktop. A desktop installs the cask
# `immich-mount` instead, which is the whole app and has the same daemon in it; the two do not go together.

  # inside `on_linux`, macOS sees an empty spec and every `brew` command errors. So x86_64 Linux is the top-level
  # default, and `depends_on :linux` is what keeps macOS from installing it.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Immich Mount needs FUSE from your distribution's fuse3 package:
        sudo dnf install fuse3      # or: sudo apt install fuse3
      Sign in, then mount it now and at every login:
        immich-mount login --server https://photos.example.org
        immich-mount mount
      On a desktop, install the app instead, which has this in it:
        brew uninstall immich-mount-headless
        brew install jakobhviid/tap/immich-mount
      Immich Mount is an independent, unofficial project, not affiliated with the Immich project or FUTO.
